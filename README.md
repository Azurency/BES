## Introduction
This is my third UI mod (after Better Trade Screen and More Lenses). The main purpose is similiar to the other two, to add *Quality of Life* features and improve the Civlization VI UI. Here the Espionage Screens are overhauled to reduce the number of clicks and find the right information quickly.

## Main Features
#### Disctrict Filter Options
Allows you to filter the cities based on their districts. So for example you wanted to select a city with Spaceport and Industrial Disctrict, check both their respective checkboxes, and any cities that **do not** have those districts will be hidden.

You can also filter based on civilizations.

#### Mission List
Mission list is shown as a side screen, rather than replacing the destination list.
